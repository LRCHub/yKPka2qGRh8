Picture yourself in the shade of a tree
Alone in your thoughts but you're held by the breeze
With sand on your fingers and dirt in your hands
As you try your best to understand

Don't look at you and don't look at me
Don't hold on to what you think sets you free
Just sit at the end of the road
And begin to be still

Where could it?
Under the tree

You look for a thread of what's true in the wind
As it passes and then disappears
And you're left there standing
To finally face all your fears

Under the tree, yeah
Under the tree, yeah

It might take a minute
It might fly away
You might have to come back
On some other day

But sooner or later
An answer will come
If you stay for a minute and see

The solitude nightmare
That once made you run
Is off in the distance
Can't hurt anyone

And maybe there's something
To learn in the calm of the sea

Where could it?
Under the tree

You look for a thread of what's true in the wind
As it passes and then disappears
And you're left there standing
To finally face all your fears

Under the tree, yeah
Under the tree, yeah

Under the tree, yeah
Under the tree, yeah
