Where are you at?
Where have you been?
問いかけに答えはなく
Where are we headed?
What did you mean?
追いかけても　遅く　遠く
A bird, a butterfly,
and my red scarf
Don’t make a mess of memories
Just let me heal your scars
The wall,
the owl and forgotten wharf
時が止まることもなく
We’re getting older
second by second by second
Why oh why, Why oh why
Don’t you want to stay with me?
Why oh why, Why oh why
Are you giving up on me?
I’ll be waiting,
waiting for you
Let me hold you under the tree
Under the tree
I’ll protect you
